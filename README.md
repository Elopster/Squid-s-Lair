My first game!
Hello, I made this text based game using Python and mainly using functions and here are some of the features I plan to add in the future to make it better.
Sound effects if possible (not sure how to do this yet)
Figure out how to let other people play it (I have some idea on this, I think I need to download the required files at the beginning somehow so users have the same files as me)
Make the game more responsive (What I mean by this is, let the game be less strict on responses. Currently you must type exactly the same string to change rooms or take actions)
